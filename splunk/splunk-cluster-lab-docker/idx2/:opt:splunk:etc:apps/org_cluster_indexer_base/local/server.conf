# In distributed environments, it's common to have a lone search head acting
# as the license manager as well. In this configuration, providing the URI
# of the license manager is easiest within the indexer_base configuration.
# In the event that there are multiple search heads, you could instead use
# the org_full_license_server app, shipped to the non-license SH, as well
# as all of the indexers. In either event, the settings are the same.

# Example: master_uri = https://10.2.1.3:8089
# master_uri = https://IP.of.license.master:mgmt_port
# * DEPRECATED. Use the 'manager_uri' setting instead.
# manager_uri = https://IP.of.license.manager:mgmt_port
